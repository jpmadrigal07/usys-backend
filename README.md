# Getting Started with USYS

This is the backend service of the App.

## Available Scripts

We strictly use [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) for this project.
If Yarn is not installed in your machine, simply run this command:

### `npm i yarn -g`

Before running the service, run this first:

### `yarn`

to install all the neccessary dependencies.

After installation, you can now run the service using this command:

### `yarn start`

to start the app.
